## Start by drawing

Print out [mockup.jpg]() and use a pencil to draw a box for EVERY element you think belongs on the page. That means EVERYTHING

## Add thee tags

Once you have your boxes defined, start adding HTML elements to your `index.html` page. Don't worry about styling. Just add tags where they need to go. If it helps, add a single CSS rule that puts a border around everything, like this:

```css
* {
    border: 1px solid blue;
}
```

## Go mobile

We've given you a mockup for desktop, but we'd like you to make the site work on a mobile-width first. First step: Think about what will change on mobile. Write out those decisions on your printout. Draw some arrows that explain how things will look on mobile. Maybe flip the page over or use a new page to sketch it out.

## CSS

Now it's time to start writing CSS. Create a `screen.css`, include in your HTML file (as well as `reset.css`), and start adding styles to it to make the mobile site work. No media queries needed yet.

## Media queries

Once your site looks right on mobile, you can add media queries to add styles that get applied on wider screens. Pick a good breakpoint (look at the Coffee Roasters site for some good ideas), and add the rules you need to make it look good.
